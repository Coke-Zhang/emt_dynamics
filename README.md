### Scripts used for "Comparing transcriptional dynamics of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition"
![Alt text](figure_1.tiff)

Knitted versions of the scripts will be available within the next day or two. In the meantime, I've uploaded RMDs used for the core processing of the data into processing_notebooks/ and scripts to generate all figures panels in figure_notebooks/.

As for the data, we are currently wrangling all of the sequencing files into GEO's submission form. I'll post the accession here as soon as it is available. In the meantime, I have uploaded fully processed Seurat (v3) objects and CSV files of raw UMIs and associated metadata on a public Google Drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lZ38Uj2ZjmFus7XbHGTATh8f9MqXLAf_)

### Scripts used for "Comparing transcriptional dynamics of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition"

Scripts will be uploaded in the next day or two.

As for the data, we are currently wrangling all of the sequencing files into GEO's submission form. I'll post the accession here as soon as it is available.

In the meantime, I will gladly share code/data if you get in touch with me at david.cook@uottawa.ca

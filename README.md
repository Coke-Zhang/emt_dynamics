### Scripts used for "Comparing transcriptional dynamics of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition"
![Alt text](figure_1.tiff)

Knitted versions of the scripts will be available within the next day or two. In the meantime, I've uploaded RMDs used for the core processing of the data into processing_notebooks/ and scripts to generate all figures panels in figure_notebooks/.

As for the data, we are currently wrangling all of the sequencing files into GEO's submission form. I'll post the accession here as soon as it is available.

In the meantime, I will gladly share code/data if you get in touch with me at david.cook@uottawa.ca
